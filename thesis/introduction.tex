\section{Synopsis}

The remainder of this thesis is organized into the following chapters.

\chaptersynopsis{chap:adDerivation}
With the transport equation in hand, we derive a new approximation to radiation
transport, anisotropic diffusion. The derivation accounts for both time
dependence and boundary conditions. We then discuss some of the properties of
the AD method and make predictions for its range of applicability.

\chaptersynopsis{chap:conclusion}
The final chapter summarizes the results of the theory developed in this thesis
and its application to TRT problems. We discuss possible improvements to the new
methods and other future work.
